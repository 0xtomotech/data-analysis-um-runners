# Ultra Marathon Runners Data Analysis

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis on the results of ultra marathon runners over the past two decades. The data for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, and the analysis will be conducted using Python, along with the libraries Pandas and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains comprehensive information about ultra marathon runners, including their race results, demographics, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is available on Kaggle and can be accessed [here](link-to-dataset).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. Data Preparation: In this section, the dataset will be loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed to ensure its suitability for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: This section focuses on exploring the dataset, identifying patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. Visualizations using Seaborn will be used to gain insights from the data.

3. Statistical Analysis: In this section, statistical techniques will be applied to further analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions. Hypothesis testing and regression analysis may be performed to uncover relationships and make predictions.

4. Conclusion: The final section summarizes the findings of the analysis and provides insights into the performance and characteristics of ultra marathon runners over the past two decades.
